PROBLEM
- write a program
- prompt the user for two positive integers
- the program must compute the following operations:
  addition, subtraction, product, quotient, remained and power. 
- input doesnt need to be validated.
- INPUT - two integers
- OUTPUT - result of computation performed on integers

EXAMPLES
==> Enter the first number:
23
==> Enter the second number:
17
==> 23 + 17 = 40
==> 23 - 17 = 6
==> 23 * 17 = 391
==> 23 / 17 = 1
==> 23 % 17 = 6
==> 23 ** 17 = 141050039560662968926103
