PEDAC

PROBLEM
- Write a method
- the method must take an array
- the method must return an array with every odd index.
- INPUT: The input will be an array
- OUTPUT: The output will be an array


EXAMPLES
oddities([2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == [2, 4, 6]
oddities([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == [1, 3, 5]
oddities(['abc', 'def']) == ['abc']
oddities([123]) == [123]
oddities([]) == []


DATA STRUCTURES
INPUT: array

Output: array


ALGORITHM
1. define a method called oddities, have the array take an array as an input
2. iterate over the array, if the index is odd, have it saved to a new array.
3. return the new array.
