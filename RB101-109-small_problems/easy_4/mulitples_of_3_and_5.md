PEDAC

PROBLEM
- Write a method that takes an integer as an arguement
- Have the method search for all multiples of 3 and 5 that lie between 1 and the given integer.
- The method then must compute the sum of the multiples.


EXAMPLES
For instance, if the supplied number is 20, the result should be 98 (3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 20).
multisum(3) == 3
multisum(5) == 8
multisum(10) == 33
multisum(1000) == 234168

DATA STRUCTURES
INPUT: Integer
The method will generate an array.
OUTPUT: Integer


ALGORITHM
1. write a method that takes an integer as an agrument
2. create an array with all of the multiples of 3 and 5 between 1 and the given number
3. sum all of the elements
4. return the sum
